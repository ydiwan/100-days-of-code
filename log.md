// **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

// **Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: April 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Starting the Odin Project. going through the Fundamentals section. Also registered for a Pre-Calc course on Coursera. 

**Thoughts** Pretty excited overall, i want to do big things and want to be successful in everything that I do. Hopefully this is one of those things. Also gonna try the pomodoro clock thing. seems pretty interesting. Other than that, I gotta stop distractions and remember to not let the monkey take control of my brain. [Procrastination Article](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) Also want to start doing the 100 Days of Gratitude Thing starting monday.

### Day 2: April 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Ubuntu setup, more progress on Fundamentals.

**Thoughts** Messed around with getting Ubuntu to dual-boot. Not much luck so ig its VM for now unless someone in the Discord helps out. Idk if i should do a lot or wait until the PC comes to actually get started. Ig i could just work on the math until it comes.
